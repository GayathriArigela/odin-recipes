    <h1><b>BIRYANI</b></h1>
    <p>Biryani (pronounced 'beer-ya-nee'), in its most fundamental form, is a layered rice dish made with Indian spices, rice, fresh herbs, and usually some type of protein, such as meat, cheese, or egg. It is traditionally assembled in a clay pot, sealed with dough, and cooked for hours over a low flame
        Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics it's marinated in.
