    <h1><b>PANNER TIKKA</b></h1>
    <p>Paneer tikka or Paneer Soola or Chhena Soola is an Indian dish made from chunks of paneer/ chhena marinated in spices and grilled in a tandoor. It is a vegetarian alternative to chicken tikka and other meat dishes. It is a popular dish that is widely available in India and countries with an Indian diaspora
        Tikka dishes involve marinating meats and/or vegetables, or in this case paneer (a cheese), in a spiced yogurt mixture. What is this? “Tikka” means “small chunks” in Hindi, since you generally cut everything into chunks before threading on skewers.
